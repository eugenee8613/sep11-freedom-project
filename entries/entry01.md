For my tool I have decided to work with a partner. We have decided to work on firebase. Me and my parnter decided to work on this we want to try something different. Mostly everybody in our class is making the same thing. Most of them are making a game and that is borning to us. We want to make a health tracker that is beneficial to all people. It can help track your calorie intake and help track how much calories you burned today. Right now for the Engineering Design Process we are up to the Research part because we are trying to research ways how to begin on firebase and how to use firebase to help you create a health tracker. Some skills that will I be developing outside of my project is communication since I am communicating with my parnter more and learning how to stay on task and be focused.
