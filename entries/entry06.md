# Entry 6
##### 5/25/23

Throughout the year me and my partner have been learning and creating our project using firebase. There were some difficult times but we pushed through and finished. During the expo elevator pitch I enjoyed looking at other students' projects because its cool to see what other people can create. I liked how a lot of people came up to our table and gave us good reviews on our project. The in-class presentation for me was very nerveracking. I was really nervous to go up and present to the entire class. I could've done better by maybe thorougly explaining the code a bit more. I could also improve by explaining the errors that I had and how I managed to fix them.
