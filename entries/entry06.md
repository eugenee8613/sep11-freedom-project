# Entry 6
##### 5/25/23

Throughout the year me and my partner have been learning and creating our project using firebase. There were some difficult times but we pushed through and finished. During the expo elevator pitch I enjoyed looking at other students' projects because its cool to see what other people can create. I liked how a lot of people came up to our table and gave us good reviews on our project. The in-class presentation for me was very nerveracking. I was really nervous to go up and present to the entire class. I could've done better by maybe thorougly explaining the code a bit more. I could also improve by explaining the errors that I had and how I managed to fix them.

### Skills
Some skills that I have developed during this project were communication, debugging, and collaboration. Some skills that I had trouble on were time management since me and my partner procrastinated mostly thoughout the year. We also were busy so we couldn't really spare time for the project. I developed communication by always texting and calling my partner so we can do the project at home since we don't have the same class periods. Also , I developed debugging by going through the code thorougly with my partner and trying to understand the errors.



### EDP
Currently me and my partner are up to the IMPROVE part of the EDP. We are focusing on making the product more entertainable for the users by adding buttons with different selections for the Upper Body, Lower Body, Cardio. Also if the  user wants to build different goals like cutting weight, and building muscle. We will add more data in the firebase database so that the data transferes into our ide. We want to also make the firebase generate a random workout based on the users selections.
